### [Seeking Help](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/03-seeking-help/index.html)

## Key Points

Use `help()` or `?` to get help in R.
:::

#### Challenge 1

Look at the help page for `c`. What kind of vector do you expect will be created if you evaluate the following?

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c('d', 'e', 'f')
c(1, 2, 'f')
```

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

The first command results in a numeric vector. The second results in a character vector. The third command results in a character vector, because it includes character values.

<!-- Challenge 1 answer end -->

#### Challenge 2

Look at the help for the `paste` function. You will need to use it later. What's the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments?

<!-- Challenge 2 answer begin -->

Sep controls how the terms are pasted together, while collapse controls how the results are pasted together. When collapse is NULL, you might get a vector of character strings, but when specifying a value for collapse, you will get a single character string.

<!-- Challenge 2 answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

Use help to find a function (and its associated parameters) that you could use to load data from a tabular file in which columns are delimited with "\t\" (tab) and the decimal point is a"." (period). This check for decimal separator is important, especially if you are working with international colleagues, because different countries have different conventions for the decimal point (i.e. comma vs period).

# Hint

Use `??"read table"` to look up functions related to reading in tabular data.
:::

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

We could use `read.table` and set `sep = '\t'`, or we could use the default parameters for `read.delim`.
