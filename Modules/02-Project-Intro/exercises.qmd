## Key Points

-   Use RStudio to create and manage projects with consistent layout.
-   Treat raw data as read-only.
-   Treat generated output as disposable.
-   Separate function definition and application.

#### Challenge 1

Create a self-contained project

We're going to turn our Learning-R project into a project in RStudio:

1.  If you haven't already, clone your Learning-R project onto your local machine.
2.  In RStudio, click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
3.  Click "Existing Directory" and locate the directory containing your Learning-R project.
4.  Click the "Create Project" button.

#### Challenge 2

Open an RStudio project through the file system

1.  Exit RStudio.
2.  Open to your Learning-R project directory in the File Explorer or Finder app.
3.  Double click the `.Rproj` file in the root directory of your course project repository.
4.  Open your copy of `Modules/02-Project_Intro/exercises.qmd` in RStudio.
5.  Take a screenshot of your RStudio session and place it in the `Modules/02-Project-Intro/` directory. It should have "Learning-R - main - RStudio" in the header (or something similar).
6.  Modify the line just below this to include your screenshot (you should just need to replace "screenshot.png" with the name of your screenshot file).

#### Challenge 3

You should have installed the `gapminder` package. If you are following along with the Software Carpentry notes, they ask us to download the gapminder data set at this point. Instead, we'll load it directly from the `gapminder` package (i.e. all you need to do for this challenge is be sure the `gapminder` package is installed).

```{r}
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)
# let's take a look at the data we'll be working with
gapminder
```
